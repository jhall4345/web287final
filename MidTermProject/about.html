            <p class="main-text">Hello, my name is Jonathan Hall and I am graduating from the Web Development program at Wake Tech CC in the Spring of 2023. I recently started working full-time with a local start-up, CommerceCX, as an Associate Full-Stack Developer in training. To this point in my web development journey, I have been mostly focused on front-end development, UI, dynamic user experience. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and have had several project experiences using Bootstrap, Angular, and Kendo UI frameworks.</p><br>
            <p class="main-text">I am working to compliment this skill-set with backend, server-side, database programming skills to broaden my abilities. More specifically I have been learning SQL and some PHP, but have intentions of returning to Wake Tech to take additional classes in Python development. Another endeavor on this journey that I would like to mention is my on-going training and self-study on the Salesforce platform in efforts to become a Salesforce Certified Admin.</p><br>
            <p class="main-text">Previously, I have had many years of experience in customer service, management, leadership, and creative output in the culinary and health and wellness fields. Personally, I have a passion for cooking, hiking, skiing, travel, yoga, live music, and spending quality time with my family and friends. While not at work or school, I keep good company with my 3 year old Boston Terrier pup, Toby!</p>
